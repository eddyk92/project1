Project 1 was a real joy. I started with making a battleship app, which is what most of these branches display, however, I decided to switch gears and create an app showing all pizza location around SF using Google's Map API. 

In the file on the master branch named 'project' you will see the index.html, app.js, app.css, img directory, store-locator.min.js, and jquery-1.11.3.min.js.  


By the time I'm finished this app it will show every pizza place around San Francisco. I used the api from SF OpenData
